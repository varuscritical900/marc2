      description: "Bateaux Massage - is a mini project that I developed during my time at KodeGo, a bootcamp company. The project uses a combination of HTML5, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript, with 40% Bootstrap used to assist in the design. However, most of the design was done with personalized CSS, which means that I put in a lot of effort to create a unique and visually appealing design. From the project name, it appears that Bateaux Massage is related to massage services that might be provided on a boat, or at home, hotel or in spa. My website include information about different types of massages, hair styles, and other services available, it also include pricing, contact information, and possibly even an appointment booking system. The KodeGo Five Star Web Application Award is a recognition of the high quality of your work. It indicates that your project was not only visually appealing but also functional, user-friendly, and met the requirements of the project brief. Overall, this is a great achievement and a testament to your hard work and skill in web development."
